title: "PriorDB"

PriorDB aims to make choosing a prior for a Bayesian model easier.  As
the prior cannot be understood without the context of the model
[@gelmanPriorCanOften2017], the first thing to do is choose a model in
the sidebar. For each model, the parameters requiring priors are
listed, as well as recommended defaults and comparisons between them
(if they are available).

Models are broadly grouped by structure and then categorized by
properties of the outcome variable.
