# PriorDB

PriorDB aims to make choosing a prior for a Bayesian model easier. As the prior [cannot be understood without the context of the model](https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/19/10/555), the first thing to do is choose a model. You can find an HTML version of this repository at [https://prior-db.github.io/](https://prior-db.github.io/)

For each model, the parameters requiring priors are listed, as well as recommended defaults and comparisons between them (if they are available). Models are broadly grouped by structure and then categorized by properties of the outcome variable.
