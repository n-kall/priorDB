Regression models can be used to predict outcomes from
predictors. A linear predictor term $\eta$ based on the predictors is
passed through an inverse link function, $g^{-1}$, and then used in the
observation model, $f$. The observation model may have other
parameters $\theta$ which are not necessarily determined through the
predictors.

$$
\begin{align}
y_i &\sim f(g^{-1}(\eta), \theta) \\
\eta_i &= \alpha + \beta x_i
\end{align}
$$

Depending on the choice of $f$, different link functions $g$ are
used. For example, if $f$ is the $\text{normal}$ distribution, $g$ is
the identity function. If $f$ is the $\text{Bernoulli}$ distribution,
$g$ is most commonly the logit function.
