title: Continuous bounded outcome
---

For lower-bounded observations, there are the [gamma model](gamma.qmd),
[lognormal](lognormal.qmd)

For both upper- and lower-bounded observations, the [beta model] may
be appropriate, particularly if the bounds are 0 and 1 (or can be transformed to this scale).
