title: Binomial model
---

## Description

The binomial model is a model of counts of binary outcomes in sets of trials.

## Definition

For counts of successes $y$, number of trials $N$ and predictors $x$, the model is:

$$
\begin{align}
y_i \sim \text{Binomial}(N_i, \exp{(\eta_i)}) \\
\eta_i = \alpha + \beta \cdot x_i
\end{align}
$$

Where $y_i$ is the number of successes and $N_i$ is the number of trials
for observation $i$.

## Parameters needing priors

- $\alpha$ (intercept)
- $\beta$ (predictor weights)
