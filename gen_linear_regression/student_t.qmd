title: Student-t model
---

## Description

Linear regression with Student-t distributed residuals is also called
robust regression.

## Definition

For continuous unbounded outcome $y$ and predictors $x$, the model is:

$$
\begin{align}
y_i &\sim \text{StudentT}(\nu, \eta_i, \sigma) \\
\eta_i &= \alpha + \beta \cdot x_i
\end{align}
$$

## Parameters needing priors:

- $\alpha$ (intercept)
- $\beta$ (predictor weights)
- $\sigma$ (observation model standard deviation)
- $\nu$ (degrees of freedom)

## Prior for $\alpha$

## Prior for $\beta$

## Prior for $\nu$

### Weakly informative gamma prior

A gamma prior that has increasing density from zero to ~30 was
analysed by [@juarezModelBasedClusteringNonGaussian2010].

$$
\nu \sim \text{gamma}(2, 0.1)
$$

### Penalized complexity prior
