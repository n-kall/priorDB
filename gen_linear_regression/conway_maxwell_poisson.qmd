title: Conway-Maxwell-Poisson model
---

## Description

The Conway-Maxwell-Poisson distribution is used to model count data.

## Definition

For non-negative discrete outcome $y$ and predictors $x$, the model is:

$$
P(X = x) = \frac{\lambda^x}{(x!)^\nu Z(\lambda, \nu)}
$$

## 

This is based on [@meyerNonWeaklyInformativePriors2023].
