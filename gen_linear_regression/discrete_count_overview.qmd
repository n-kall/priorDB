title: Discrete count outcome
---

Counts can be considered in different ways. If the count represents
simple counting of observations, the [Poisson model](poisson.qmd) may
be an appropriate starting point. However, if there is
over-dispersion, the [negative binomial](negative_binomial.qmd) may
better capture the data.

If the counts are of the number of successes in repeated binary
trials, then the [binomial model](binomial.qmd) is appropriate.

In cases where there is an over-representation of zeroes in the
data, this can be modelled with zero-inflated versions of the
distributions.
